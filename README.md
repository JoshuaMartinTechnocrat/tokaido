Getting this message or something similar?

```sh
import /Users/jimmycann/www/golang/pkg/darwin_amd64/bitbucket.org/ironstar/tokaido-cli/utils.a: object is [darwin amd64 go1.9.2 X:framepointer] expected [darwin amd64 go1.10.2 X:framepointer]
```

There are two versions of go installed on your system. Easiest is to remove the version in `/usr/local/go` with `sudo rm -rfv /usr/local/go`. Your brew installed version should now be working, check your version with `go version`
